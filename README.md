The program is based on the discord.py package (https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

##### Bot operating procedure:
1) Get channel by id
2) Get messages from channel
3) Get info (users who sent messages with their account details, reactions and users who sent reactions)
4) Send info in direct message

In order to start using the bot, it is necessary to:
- Install requirements **pip install -r requirements.txt**
- Specify the Token, as well as the id of the chat in which the check will be carried out. We will use `config.py` file for this.
